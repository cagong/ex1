    <h2>Interface</h2>
    <h3>1.7.2016</h3>
    <p>An interface that I use often is my phone. I think the way that it was designed is easy to learn how to use. I find that it is very useful for many things other than only calling and texting people. It can be used for many things such as navagating, calculating, taking photos, storing images, looking at various social media applications, playing games, browsing the web, and many other things that a computer can do. It is also customizable to fit anyone's taste.</p>
