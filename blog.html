    <h2>Exercise 3 Final Design</h2>
    <h3>1.28.2016</h3>
    <p>For my final version of Exercise 3, I chose to have a vertical timeline in the middle of the page where the times are shown when hovered over each colored block. When the blocks are clicked, they're moved to the side and the description of each time appears. I also included a navigation bar at the top that shows what each color represents. When it is clicked, all of the descriptions of that color would show and when clicked again, it hides the description again.</p>

    <h2>Web-Based Form</h2>
    <h3>1.19.2016</h3>
    <p>A web based form that I use often is Youtube. It has good interactive design because it is well laid out and easy to navigate through. The navigation bar is a colunm on the left that can be hidden when not needed. Everything in the navigation also includes icons to show what they are. I also find it effective to include the list of subcriptions in the navigation so that it would be easy to get to. I also like how the subscription and home page include enough information on the videos shown to know enough about what the videos are about.</p>

    <h2>Interface</h2>
    <h3>1.7.2016</h3>
    <p>An interface that I use often is my phone. I think the way that it was designed is easy to learn how to use. I find that it is very useful for many things other than only calling and texting people. It can be used for many things such as navagating, calculating, taking photos, storing images, looking at various social media applications, playing games, browsing the web, and many other things that a computer can do. It is also customizable to fit anyone's taste.</p>
